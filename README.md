# Help-me-please-no-idea-what-to-do-
I really have no idea what I'm doing or any idea what all this smart code talk means. I've been reading &amp; trying to do this myself for some time now &amp; although I feel I've found some information it's not enough. Essentially I would like somebody to help me find out if A) my phone is somehow being blocked or limited from seeing. Certain things such as websites or user data &amp; B) find out if my wife is secretly a code genius who has all these secrets stored deep into some technology thing that I don't comprehend. I believe she has maybe alternate log in codes that only show certain apps on her phone? &amp; is it possible for her to have some kind of journal thing going on via Google books? Alternate aliases, administrator on our Verizon cellphone plan where she somehow doesn't have calls she receives &amp; texts showing up? I just don't know. Someone please help me.
